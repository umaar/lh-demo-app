## lhci-heroku

An small Node.js web app which you can use to run Lighthouse audits against.

To see the webpage which we will be testing:

```sh
npm install
npm start
# open up http://localhost:3000/
```

Please stop (Ctrl + C) the web server before running Lighthouse audits, as Lighthouse will take care of that itself.
